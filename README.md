==============
Preprocessing 
==============
First of all preprocessing are programme with two multiple languages but not have connected together C++ and Python. C++ are work for preprocessing to create commad to execute and create pixels forders and in that given dataset have multiple folders for multiple objects so same to same in C++ And Python also C++ create commad with dataset path and python will create pixels folder in current directory and make .txt file of multiple objects in count of limit and stores the normalized pixels in that.
Now Let's How to create pixels folder that collection of given dataset multiple object images pixels to normalized and create txt files.

Now as you can see we have created the pixels folder and cretes .txt file that have image normalized pixels.

As you can you seen the down side of my pixels folder image that are 6 line there means what? when i give path dataset in that two folders have 5 images in each. So my progamme will one poxels in one with heigth * widths  = one_line eg. 64 * 64 = 4096 without ",".
